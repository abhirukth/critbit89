critbit89 - A implementation of DJB's cribit trees for strings in C89
=====================================================================

Hereby placed under public domain, just like the original implementation.

This implementation closely follows the code generated from the original
CWEB source by Dan Bernstein (found at https://github.com/agl/critbit),
but should be more portable. Additionally, custom memory allocators can
be used.
